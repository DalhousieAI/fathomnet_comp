# Introduction
The purpose of this repo is to provide code and a description of the methods employed by the Dal team in our efforts participating in the FathomNet 2025 Kaggle competition. Although we experimented with a number of different approaches, there are two methods which we credit with the majority of our progress: distance-weighted cross-entropy loss, and ensemble-based self-training.
